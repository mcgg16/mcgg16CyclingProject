            <h1>Cycling</h1>
            <p>Cycling has a rich history that dates back to the early 19th century. The first known prototype of a bicycle, called the "dandy horse" or "Laufmaschine," was invented by Karl Drais in 1817. This two-wheeled, pedal-less vehicle paved the way for further innovations, including the introduction of pedals by Pierre Michaux and Pierre Lallement in the 1860s, which led to the creation of the "boneshaker" bicycle. By the late 19th century, the "safety bicycle" emerged with two similarly sized wheels and a chain-driven rear wheel, providing greater stability and comfort. This design closely resembles modern bicycles and contributed to the surge in cycling's popularity as both a mode of transportation and a recreational activity. Today, cycling is also a highly competitive sport, governed by the <a class="text-link" href="https://www.uci.org/" target="_blank">Union Cycliste Internationale</a> (UCI), which regulates everything from equipment standards to race formats to ensure fairness and consistency in professional competitions.</p>

                <p>Road cycling began in the late 19th century, primairly in Western European countries such as France, Spain, Italy, and the Low Countries. It is currently the most popular format for bike races, which can either occur in a single day or take on a "tour" modality that consists of several stages where riders accumulate points to then determine the winner. The races themselves can be either mass start events, meaning that all of the riders begin competing at the same time, or time trials, where individuals or teams ride along the same course at different moments to then compare the fastest time to determine the winner.</p>

            <ul>
                <li><b>Climber</b> - cyclists who specialize in climbing are those who can go up inclined surfaces faster than others.</li>
                <li><b>Puncher</b> - this type of cyclist specializes in rolling terrains with short but steep climbs, where they can generate a lot of power to escape the peloton.</li>
                <li><b>Sprinter </b> - sprinters are those who can reach sustain really high speeds for short periods of time.</li>
                <li><b>Time-trialist</b> - these riders can sustain high speeds over medium length courses.</li>
                <li><b>All-rounder</b> - these cyclists perform well on any surface, regardless of its inclination.</li>

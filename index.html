            <h1>Cycling</h1>
            <p>Cycling has a rich history that dates back to the early 19th century. The first known prototype of a bicycle, called the "dandy horse" or "Laufmaschine," was invented by Karl Drais in 1817. This two-wheeled, pedal-less vehicle paved the way for further innovations, including the introduction of pedals by Pierre Michaux and Pierre Lallement in the 1860s, which led to the creation of the "boneshaker" bicycle. By the late 19th century, the "safety bicycle" emerged with two similarly sized wheels and a chain-driven rear wheel, providing greater stability and comfort. This design closely resembles modern bicycles and contributed to the surge in cycling's popularity as both a mode of transportation and a recreational activity. Today, cycling is also a highly competitive sport, governed by the <a class="text-link" href="https://www.uci.org/" target="_blank">Union Cycliste Internationale</a> (UCI), which regulates everything from equipment standards to race formats to ensure fairness and consistency in professional competitions.</p>

                <p>Road cycling is the most popular format for bike races, primarily mass start events–where riders begin the race at the same time–and time trials–where individuals or teams ride along a course and their finish times are compared to determine the winner. Said races can either consist of a single event, or have a tour format, which consist of multiple stages to determine the winner. This type of racing began in the late 19th century, primairly in Western European countries such as France, Spain, Italy, and the Low Countries.</p>

            <h1>Cycling</h1>
            <p>Cycling has a rich history that dates back to the early 19th century. The first known prototype of a bicycle, called the "dandy horse" or "Laufmaschine," was invented by Karl Drais in 1817. This two-wheeled, pedal-less vehicle paved the way for further innovations, including the introduction of pedals by Pierre Michaux and Pierre Lallement in the 1860s, which led to the creation of the "boneshaker" bicycle. By the late 19th century, the "safety bicycle" emerged with two similarly sized wheels and a chain-driven rear wheel, providing greater stability and comfort. This design closely resembles modern bicycles and contributed to the surge in cycling's popularity as both a mode of transportation and a recreational activity. Over time, advancements in materials and technology have shaped cycling into the competitive sport and beloved pastime it is today.</p>

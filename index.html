            <h1>Cycling</h1>
            <p>Cycling has a rich history that dates back to the early 19th century. The first known prototype of a bicycle, called the "dandy horse" or "Laufmaschine," was invented by Karl Drais in 1817. This two-wheeled, pedal-less vehicle paved the way for further innovations, including the introduction of pedals by Pierre Michaux and Pierre Lallement in the 1860s, which led to the creation of the "boneshaker" bicycle. By the late 19th century, the "safety bicycle" emerged with two similarly sized wheels and a chain-driven rear wheel, providing greater stability and comfort. This design closely resembles modern bicycles and contributed to the surge in cycling's popularity as both a mode of transportation and a recreational activity. Today, cycling is also a highly competitive sport, governed by the <a class="text-link" href="https://www.uci.org/" target="_blank">Union Cycliste Internationale</a> (UCI), which regulates everything from equipment standards to race formats to ensure fairness and consistency in professional competitions.</p>

                <p>Road cycling began in the late 19th century, primairly in Western European countries such as France, Spain, Italy, and the Low Countries. It is currently the most popular format for bike races, which can either occur in a single day or take on a "tour" modality that consists of several stages where riders accumulate points to then determine the winner. The races themselves can be either mass start events, meaning that all of the riders begin competing at the same time, or time trials, where individuals or teams ride along the same course at different moments to then compare the fastest time to determine the winner.</p>

            <h3>Rider types</h3>
            <!-- Types of rider specializations -->
            <ul>
                <li><b>Climber</b> - cyclists who specialize in climbing are those who can go up inclined surfaces faster than others.</li>
                <li><b>Puncher</b> - this type of cyclist specializes in rolling terrains with short but steep climbs, where they can generate a lot of power to escape the peloton.</li>
                <li><b>Sprinter </b> - sprinters are those who can reach sustain really high speeds for short periods of time.</li>
                <li><b>Time-trialist</b> - these riders can sustain high speeds over medium length courses.</li>
                <li><b>All-rounder</b> - these cyclists specialize in a combination of the previous categories, meaning they perform well on any surface regardless of its inclination.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Mountain Biking</h2>
            <div class="container">
                <img src="mtbImg.jpg" alt="Picture of mountain biking">
                <p>Mountain biking (MTB) consists of cycling off-road, which emerged in the 1970s as cyclists began modifying road bikes to handle off-road terrain, particularly in places like Marin County, California. This led to the development of purpose-built mountain bikes in the 1980s, featuring sturdy frames, wide tires, and improved braking systems. Over time, advancements in materials and suspension systems further refined these bikes, making them essential for tackling rugged landscapes and trails. Since its development, MTB races have been divided into several categories.</p>
            </div>
            <h3>MTB Categories</h3>
            <!-- Types of rider specializations -->
            <ul>
                <li><b>Cross country (XCO)</b> - this disipline consists of riding from one point to another or in a loop, and it includes several climbs and descents on varied terrain. XCO is the most endurance and strength-based division, since all others place a greater focus on technical skills.</li>
                <li><b>Downhill (DH)</b> - cyclists begin at the top of the mountain and race until they reach the bottom of the track, and whoever completes the course in the least amount of time wins. This is the riskiest disipline of MTB, since some racers have hit speeds of 80 kilometers per hour, landed drops over 3 meters tall, or cleared jumps 19 meters long.</li>
                <li><b>Enduro</b> - this disipline incorporates some elements of DH racing, includes climbs, and overall consists of longer courses that sometimes take a full day to complete. Usually, there is a limit on how long cyclists can take to complete a climb, and then they are ranked based on how long it takes them to finish a downhill portion.</li>
                <li><b>Freeride</b> - riders perform flips, tricks, and jumps all while riding down natural terrain, and winners are established based on the creativity, skill, and technique employed rather than the time taken to complete a course.</li>
                <li><b>Four-cross (4X)/Dual Slalom</b> - riders compete head-to-head on a short, downhill track filled with jumps, berms, and technical features. Four-cross features four riders racing simultaneously, while Dual Slalom pits two riders against each other in parallel courses, emphasizing speed and precision.</li>
                <li><b>Dirt Jumping</b> - cyclists perform aerial tricks by launching off purpose-built dirt jumps, showcasing their creativity, control, and style. This discipline rewards riders for their ability to execute complex maneuvers mid-air and land smoothly.</li>
                <li><b>Trials</b> - racers navigate through obstacles such as rocks, logs, and man-made structures without touching the ground with their feet. Balance, precision, and bike-handling skills are essential to succeed.</li>
                <li><b>Urban/Street</b> - riders perform tricks and stunts on stairs, rails, walls, and other city structures. This freestyle discipline highlights creativity and adaptability in urban environments.</li>
                <li><b>Marathon</b> - long-distance events test riders' endurance and stamina over courses that often exceed 60 kilometers. Marathon mountain biking includes varied terrain and is as much about strategy and pacing as it is about strength.</li>
                <li><b>Bikepacking</b> - it involves carrying essential gear and supplies on the bike to explore remote areas. It emphasizes self-sufficiency and the spirit of exploration over speed or competition.</li>
            </ul>

                <p>Track cycling originated in the late 19th century, making it one of the earliest organized forms of competitive cycling. Here, racers compete on oval tracks known as velodromes, which were designed to provide a controlled environment for high-speed racing. By the 1890s, track cycling had gained international popularity, with events held in Europe, United States, and Australia. The development of specialized track bicycles, featuring lightweight frames, fixed gears, and no brakes, allowed riders to reach high speeds. Over the decades, the sport has evolved with advancements in aerodynamics and track design, becoming a cornerstone of major competitions, which are typically categorized as either sprint or endurance races.</p>

            <!-- Sprint Races -->
            <h3>Sprint Races</h3>
            <p>These races are usually fast-paced, and consist of three to eight laps around a velodrome to determine the winner</p>
            <li><b>Sprint</b> - two cyclists compete over a short distance.</li>
            <li><b>Team Sprint</b> - teams of tree men or two women take turns leading a short race, and each rider peels off after completing their designated laps.</li>
            <li><b>Keirin</b> - cyclists follow a motorized pacer that gradually increases speed, then sprint to the finish once the pacer exits the track, resulting in a thrilling, fast-paced race.</li>
            <li><b>Track Time Trial</b> - cyclists race individually against the clock over a set distance, and this race format focuses entirely on raw power and speed.</li>
            <!-- Endurance Races -->
            <h3>Endurance Races</h3>
            <p>The length of endurance events are longer, and it varies by type and gender.</p>
            <li><b>Individual Pursuit</b> - two cyclists start on opposite sides of the track, racing to either catch their opponent or attain the fastest time over the distance.</li>
            <li><b>Team Pursuit</b> - teams of four work together to achieve the fastest time over the course.</li>
            <li><b>Scratch Race</b> - mass-start race where all riders compete to finish a set number of laps first.</li>
            <li><b>Points Race</b> - racers accumulate points during intermediate sprints throughout the event or by lapping the track, with the winner having the highest total.</li>
            <li><b>Madison</b> - teams of two alternate riding and resting, exchanging positions with a hand-sling motion in a relay-style endurance race that includes sprints for points.</li>
            <li><b>Omnium</b> - multi-event competition where cyclists earn points across various endurance events, and the overall winner is the one with the highest total score.</li>
